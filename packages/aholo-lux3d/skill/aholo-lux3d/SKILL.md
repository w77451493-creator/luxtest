# Aholo Lux3D

Read the packaged [production workflow](body.md), then its references for the
current stage. This portable Skill uses its own [OpenAPI runtime](core/runtime/lux3d_client.py),
contracts and viewer. Resolve paths from this installed Skill, independent of
the current directory. The host must support local Python processes, file
access, HTTPS and secure credential injection. Python, dependency downloads
and Blender are not bundled. Communicate in the user's language.

## Install the shared portal package

The public portal provides one complete Skill ZIP for every compatible host.
Install the extracted `aholo-lux3d` directory using the current host's local Skill
installation mechanism. The same downloaded files work in Codex, DeepSeek,
Doubao (豆包) and other compatible hosts; no ecosystem-specific rebuild or user
profile selection is required. Hosts must actually support local Skills and
process/file tools; this ZIP cannot add those capabilities to a chat-only app.
Ecosystem marketplace packages remain separate optional distribution channels.

## Resolve the current host automatically

Before account or quote calls, resolve the real **host application**, independent
of the model provider. `scripts/host_identity.py` uses native session metadata
when available: nonempty `CODEX_THREAD_ID` identifies Codex, and `CLAUDECODE=1`
identifies Claude Code (see the [official Claude environment reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/env-vars)).
The host agent must otherwise automatically supply its actual application name
from current host context via `--host-name NAME`; integrations can supply
`LUX3D_HOST_NAME` to the child process instead. This is metadata supplied by the
agent or integration, not a selection users need to make. Do not invent session
variables for other hosts, use the selected model's name, infer identity from
an installation path, or copy a host name from a user generation prompt.

```text
python <installed-skill>/scripts/host_identity.py detect
python <installed-skill>/scripts/host_identity.py detect --host-name <actual-current-host-name>
```

The second form is executed by the current host agent when native metadata is
unavailable. It reads the same packaged `host-identity.json` registry used by
the Connector. Known aliases are matched after trimming and lowercasing;
unregistered names retain their trimmed spelling. Detection needs only Python's
standard library, no API key, region selection or network access.

| Actual host | source | agentName |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | `1` | `codex` |
| Claude Code | `2` | `claude-code` |
| DeepSeek | `3` | `deepseek` |
| WorkBuddy | `4` | `workbuddy` |
| Any other host, for example 豆包 | `100` | Actual host name, for example `豆包` |

The installed `adapter.json` declares `identityMode: automatic-host`; it never
pins a source or profile. `--source` and `--binding` are unsupported. Users do
not create identity files. If native markers and supplied host metadata
conflict, stop before the API call so the integration can correct the subprocess
context. If no metadata is observable, the host agent must provide it from its
own host context; the helper does not guess. Missing/invalid metadata yields
structured errors. Identity is attribution, not an authentication boundary.

For source 100, both account GET and quote POST carry the actual `agentName`.
For known sources, account GET carries the registered source and quote POST
also carries its canonical name. Keep host identity stable within an attempt;
record it with region, account reference and `skill` mode. Refresh account
facts and quotes after changing the host, credential or region.

## Prepare Python and credentials

Run the setup helper with an available Python 3.10 or newer interpreter:

```text
python <installed-skill>/scripts/setup_runtime.py --env-dir <writable-cache-root>
```

Use the returned absolute `python` path for all packaged Python commands.
`--env-dir` selects a cache root, not an existing virtual environment. It can
also be configured through `LUX3D_COMMON_ENV_DIR`; otherwise the helper uses
`XDG_CACHE_HOME/aholo-lux3d-common` or `~/.cache/aholo-lux3d-common`. Respect the
user's selected drive for caches and workspace files. Setup never writes into
the installed Skill or changes the system interpreter. Cache keys include
interpreter implementation/version/ABI, OS, architecture and dependency/runtime
digests; readiness is published atomically after dependency and import checks.
`--check` only reads existing readiness. Failed installations are never reused.
Setup may need package-index network access, but never calls Lux3D or needs a key.

For missing imports, rerun setup and use its returned interpreter. For a missing
bundled runtime or invalid adapter, reinstall the package; a broken installed
package cannot use another checkout as a fallback. For cache-lock contention,
wait for the active setup process and retry. Do not classify these as API
authentication errors.

Read [Common credential setup](references/credentials.md) before the first API
call. Choose `cn` or `international` explicitly; a failed request must never switch region. Pass the chosen region to
every runtime API even when that API has its own default. Credentials are
injected only into the selected operation's process.

## Account, quote and execution

```text
python <installed-skill>/scripts/commerce.py balance --region cn
python <installed-skill>/scripts/commerce.py quote --region cn --items <items.json>
```

When native session metadata is absent, the agent appends `--host-name` with
its actual current host name to each command automatically.

`items.json` is the numbered call map from [planning](references/planning.md).
Use the canonical `/lux3d/v1/...` paths and contract parameters; do not include
credentials, a domain, `/global`, source or account context in the plan. Quote
refreshes the account and returns `{account, quote}`. Errors are safe JSON on
stderr with a nonzero exit code. Missing or failed pricing is never free pricing.

Apply [review and approval](references/review.md) and
[execution and recovery](references/execution.md) before each charge. The host
orchestrates approval, budget and durable attempt records; these scripts do not
implement a persistent authorization gate, submission lock or exactly-once
guarantee. The separate Connector is a different execution mode. Select one
mode per operation; an uncertain submission must be reconciled before another
create call or a mode switch. Save real task IDs as strings immediately and
resume queries or delivery from the original task.

For source-file and offline-preview delivery, follow
[results](references/results.md). For composed scenes or rendering, use
[assembly](references/assembly.md) with an available Blender installation or
host tool. Report unavailable capabilities and the actual available outputs.
